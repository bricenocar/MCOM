Check all 3 backup files under configFiles folder in the root of the project:
-backup_node_modules: Read the comments and make the changes in the js files
-backup_pcf-scripts_webPackConfig: replace the webpack config with the backup file. Â¨
The webpack config is in the following path:  \node_modules\pcf-scripts\webpackConfig.js
-backup_tsconfig: Make sure the tsconfig.json and this are the same

Node Version --> 18.18.2 (Specified in package.json)
NPM Version ---> 9.8.1 (Specified in package.json)
Install and Use NVM to change node versions --> nvm install 18.18.2 and then nmv use 18.18.2

To run the app locally:
Dev mode: npm start watch
Prod mode: npm run start:watch:prod

Build and Deploy Solution:
-npm run build -- --buildMode production

-Get the publisher properties. The org Url is the environment Url:
Example:
https://{envId}.crm4.dynamics.com/api/data/v9.2/publishers?$select=uniquename,customizationprefix

Result:
{"@odata.etag":"W/\"0000000\"","uniquename":"mcom","customizationprefix":"mcom","publisherid":"4ab5ea78-f958-ed11-9562-002248000000"},

-The following command is to create config files. Run this inside the solutions folder (Within a PCF Component Folder, for ex: TermPickerControl)
pac solution init --publisher-name mcom --publisher-prefix mcom

-The following command must be run from the solutions folder where the .cdsproj file is located.
pac solution add-reference --path ../../

The result will be: Project reference successfully added to Dataverse solution project.

-Rename the generated solutions.cdsproj to the {controlname}.cdsproj
-Go to Solution.xml under the newly created path src/Other and rename from solutions to the controlname:
Example:
<UniqueName>TermPickerControl</UniqueName>
    <LocalizedNames>
        <!-- Localized Solution Name in language code -->
        <LocalizedName description="TermPickerControl" languagecode="1033" />
    </LocalizedNames>

-The following command will build the package in release mode (Managed Solution). For Unmanaged Solution remove '--configuration Release'
dotnet build --configuration Release

-The solution package is created under solutions\bin\release (For Unmanaged solution under solutions\bin\debug)
-Upload the package to PowerApps solutions (Import solution)


UPDATES - NEW VERSIONS!!!

When doing changes to the Component the version has to be incremented. 
I like to keep both the solution and the component with the same versions. 
So let's say we want to go from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2:

-Change the version in Solution.xml under ComponentFolder\solutions\src\other\solution.xml
Ex:
<Version>1.0.2</Version>

-Change the version in ControlManifest.Input.xml under the ComponentFolder
Ex:
<control namespace="Mcom.Pcf.Components" constructor="TermPickerControl" version="1.0.2" .......

Package again and import ;-)


Hope you have a nice day!!! Enjoy!!!
